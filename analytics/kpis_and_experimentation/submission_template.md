## User Story

PRODUCT: Instagram

Over the years, my interaction with Instagram has evolved significantly. Initially, I joined the platform to share personal moments and connect with friends. Over time, Instagram became an integral part of my daily routine for both personal and professional purposes. I started engaging with diverse content, exploring features like Stories and IGTV, and even using it for shopping. The platform's algorithm has played a crucial role in shaping my content discovery experience. As a user, I appreciate the platform's ability to adapt to my preferences while providing a mix of content from friends, influencers, and brands.

## Experiments

Experiment 1:  Algorithmic Feed vs. Chronological Feed

•	Changes: Control (no feature): Users see posts in the current algorithmic feed order.
•	Test Cell 1: Users see posts in chronological order.

Hypothesis: I hypothesize that switching to a chronological feed may result in increased user engagement as users have more control over the content they see, leading to a more satisfying browsing experience.

Test Cell Allocation:
•	Control (no feature) - 50%
•	Test Cell 1 (Chronological feed) - 50%

Leading Metrics:
•	Likes per post
•	Comments per post
•	Time spent on the platform

Lagging Metrics:
•	Daily active users
•	User retention rate


### Experiment 2:  Story Curation Algorithm

Changes:
•	Control (no feature): Stories are ordered based on the current algorithm.
•	Test Cell 1: Stories are ordered in chronological order




Hypothesis: 
I hypothesize that a chronological story order will lead to higher story completion rates and increased daily active users as users may find it easier to catch up on stories in a time-based sequence.

Test Cell Allocation:
•	Control (no feature) - 50%
•	Test Cell 1 (Chronological story order) - 50%

Leading Metrics:
•	Story completion rate
•	Daily active users

Lagging Metrics:
•	User engagement over time
•	Time spent on stories


## Experiment 3: Enhanced Shopping Experience


Changes:
•	Control (no feature): Users navigate through the existing shopping features.
•	Test Cell 1: Introduce personalized shopping recommendations and an enhanced browsing experience.


Hypothesis: I hypothesize that an enhanced shopping experience will lead to a higher conversion rate from product discovery to purchase, resulting in increased revenue from in-app purchases.


Test Cell Allocation:
•	Control (no feature) - 60%
•	Test Cell 1 (Enhanced shopping features) - 40%


Leading Metrics:
•	Conversion rate
•	Click-through rate on shopping recommendations


Lagging Metrics:
•	Revenue from in-app purchases
•	User satisfaction with shopping features
